This Unity package contains a First-Person Character Controller with crouching, looking & jumping behaviours preconfigured.
Uses the new input system & rigidbody physics.

Documentation is expensive so you'll have to manage on your own.
Look at the FPSController Prefab in a scene to see how stuff works, it's really simple.
